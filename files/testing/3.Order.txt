To create new order you need to be authenticated as user first, then you can do a request like this:

REQUEST:
curl -v --cookie "_SID_TXNAPP_=0c70ee48871ef1af1c2f4576ef83b01e" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_id": 1, "amount":2}' \
  -X POST 'localhost:9004/api/v1/order'

  RESPONSE:
  Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
